	abstract = {The classical electromagnetic scattering theory for a circular cylinder is extended so as to allow for the non-local response properties of metals. Using hydrodynamic dielectric functions and applying appropriate additional boundary conditions, the generalized scattering coefficients are derived. For very thin nanowires, the main extinction peak, due to the surface plasmon, is shifted from its classical position towards the high frequency side and subsidiary peaks, due to bulk plasmon excitation, appear above the plasma frequency.},
